      # Sylvain TOSONI

      Game Programming student at [Bellecour Ecole](https://www.bellecour.fr/) from France.

      I have a passion for the Game Engine programming.
      I like having a light and optimized solutions instead of using a big framework that do the most of the work.
      Even if it requires complex programming.

      Here you can find all the information about me,
      from the contacts to my projects.

      # Izydor

      This project is the first of my bachelor at [Bellecour Ecole](https://www.bellecour.fr/).

      I also used this project to try the creation of an editor using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [EFrame](https://crates.io/crates/eframe).
      So you can create your own game based on it.

      You just have to go at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eVisualUser/bellecour-gamebook/releases),
      to find the last version of the client and the editor.
      The guide is [right here](https://sylvain-game.notion.site/Guide-c3600c02665f42b8a4689875f5d09d4b).

      ## Project Restrictions

      - [X] Only C/C++.
      - [X] Only Console for rendering.
      - [X] Collaborate with 3 game designers.
      - [X] Making a story that is not too long.
      
      ## How to play

      You can play it online or using the native version.
      
      ### Web

      On the web version you must simply click on the choices buttons.

      ### Native

      Those keys suppose that you are using an AZERTY (French) keyboard.

      |Key|Action|
      |---|---|
      |Up Arrow|Select the choice upper the current|
      |Down Arrow|Select the choice under the current|
      |Escape|Exit the game|
      |+|Increase the frame size|
      |-|Decrease the frame size|

      ## Play

      So we created a game where you play as Izydor during a Zombie apocalypse in Poland.
      You can try it on web, or if you are on Windows you can download it.

      Your malware protection and Windows will warn you about the executable.

      # Pretty Engine

      <img alt="PrettyEngine Logo" src="assets/engine_logo.png" width="15%" height="15%"></img>

      Work in progress game engine for 2D games.

      I am currently working on, to learn game engine development.
      It will end by making a game using it, probably an open-world 2D game.

      For the creation part, you must code in C++ only, but with a simplified pipeline.
      The editor manage all the artist part.

      To create a game you need to duplicate the code of the engine and compile it yourself if you add some script,
      this is to allow you to custom the engine, and also the C++ scripting part need it,
      this allows the editor to have access to your custom Components and Entities.

      For the organization you can script Entities that will work standalone, and you can use polymorphism on it.
      You can also create components that is more dynamic but have some performances and memory cost.

      It is written in C++ and using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
      I choose C++ because I wanted to create an engine that would train me to improve my skills in this language.
      By C++ being very important in Game Engine development, I found it necessary to be sure that I learn things applicable to the industry.

      For the launcher I use [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), to have a solution easy to maintain and get great visuals, compared to most of native GUI/UI frameworks.
      And compared to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) I get better performances and its based on my favorite programming language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

      # Rust Crates

      I love the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
      So I have published few basic crates that I used in my personal projects.

      At now, I don't have made a big project with it, but maybe Pretty Engine will be rewritten in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) later.

      |Crates|Purpose|
      |---|---|
      |[Pretty INI](https://crates.io/crates/pretty_ini/)|Simple INI file reader/writer.|
      |[ProCSV](https://crates.io/crates/pro_csv)|Simple CSV file reader/writer|
      |[Full Logger](https://crates.io/crates/full_logger)|A simple logger using [Pretty INI](https://crates.io/crates/pretty_ini/) and [Pro CSV](https://crates.io/crates/pro_csv).|
