          <p>
            I am Sylvain Tosoni, game programmer.
            <br/>
            Currently in third year at <a href="https://www.bellecour.fr/">Bellecour</a> Ecole in Lyon, France.
            <br/>
            Focused on gameplay programming and still learning engine programming.

      <div class="overview" id="overview-pretty-engine">
        <h1>Pretty Engine</h1>

        <h2>Engine Concept</h2>
        <p>
          This engine is for learning purpose.<br/>
          Multithreaded and using <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/">Vulkan API</a> for rendering.<br/>
          The idea is be able to create with it a 3D game, that is easy to extend and maintainable.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>State of devlopement</h2>
        <p>
          The renderer got removed recently, I search for better solutions and want to improve my autonomy when using Vulkan.<br/>
          The current main work is to write an Entity Component System, and improve the data/asset management.<br/>
          The architecture with the multithreading is still a challenge, but its starting to be cleaner.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>
          The engine is in its third version, and it teach me a lot.<br/>
          <br/>
          So the choice to do multithreading and using Vulkan come from the issues I met mostly in the first version.<br/>
          The first version was using OpenGL, it was in fact more advanced, but less stable, and the performances was just acceptable.<br/>
          <br/>
          Multithreading is very important in modern programming, and for example in the current version it allow a very fast intialization, even if some parts like Vulkan intialization can take time.<br/>
          <br/>
          From it, I found a passion for engine programming, the level of complexity and the creativity coming with it.<br/>

      <div class="overview" id="overview-echoes-of-seasons">
        <h1>Echoes of Seasons</h1>

        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>
          You must solve puzzles, using the different gameplay mechnics available.<br/>
          The goal is to reach the end of each level.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          There is two main mechanics:
          <ul>
            <li>Movable objects: You can push an ice cube, and a stone. They have both their specifies.</li>
            <li>Seasons: You can change the season to change the environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with six game designers, and one other game programmer, and with eleven artists.<br/>
          Made using Unreal Engine 5.4, most of the logic is in C++.<br/>
          <br/>
          The performance aspect of the switch of season wasnt really a difficulty.<br/>
          Since Unreal Engine is well optimized when it come to change assets and materials in real-time.<br/>
          <br/>
          Even if as the devlopement goes, less asset switch was used, replaced by visual effects.<br/>
          The game is still in development, it should be released on steam later this year(2025).<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>
          It was a great project to validate my abilities with Unreal Engine in C++.<br/>
          With the new experience I would have used really different approach for the programming.<br/>
          <br/>
          It was good organisation challenge, since we were a lot of people on the project.<br/>
        </p>

      <div class="overview" id="overview-bellum">
        <h1><a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/J31DMZM53W#FGAR-cvd7viA">Bellum</a></h1>

        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>
          Top down view, with hand weapons.<br/>
          You must reach the end of the level, with or without killing all the enemies depending of the level.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Top down view.<br/>
          The player can move and hand combat.<br/>
          <br/>
          Enemies comes to the player when seeing him, when one see him, they all get alerted (optional).<br/>
          There is traps to challenge the player progression.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          Made using Unity, programmed in C# only.<br/>
          The free to play aspect was faked.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Put my Unity knowledge to a challenge.<br/>
          <br/>
          First complete game done, implying polishing at the end.<br/>
          Put for the first time in a situation where features got cut.<br/>
          <br/>
          Discovered the difficulty of working for a mobile platform (Android).<br/>

      <div class="overview" id="overview-rust">
        <h1>Rust</h1>
        <p>Compared to others this one is to present my use of Rust.</p>

        <h2>Tooling</h2>
        <p>
          Rust is my main language when it come to external tools.<br/>
          Because of its great performances and the great ammount of libraries available.<br/>
          <br/>
          My favorite GUI framework is <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri (v2.0)</a>.<br/>
          It is an alternative to Electron, but with better performances and lighter.<br/>
          <br/>
          Most of the libraries are cross-platform, making it easily compatible between Linux and Windows.<br/>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>
          This is a powerfull and safe language.<br/>
          But it come with difficulties when using async code.<br/>
          <br/>
          The community is great, and the documentation is complete.<br/>
