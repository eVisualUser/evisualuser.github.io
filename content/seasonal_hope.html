            <p>
                Final project at Bellecour Ecole.
                Use the power of the seasons to make your path through the puzzles.
                <br/>
                So the concept is straightforward, you have to solve the puzzle to access to the next level.
                For now I can't tell too much about it.
                And there is other members on the project:

            <h2>My contribution</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning I was the only programmer of the team.
                Another joined the sixth week (from another project that end up canceled).
                <br/>
                So I have written the base of the code source, and prototyped all the mechanics.
