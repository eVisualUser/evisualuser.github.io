            <h2>My journey through the coding world.</h2>
            <p>
                I first started to learn programming to build desktop softwares, and then started experimenting with Unity and Unreal Engine.<br/>
                Making Games wasn't my first idea, but after trying I found it fascinating and fun.<br/>
                This led me to try experimenting with other languages.<br/>
                <br/>
                After this, I got into <a href="https://www.bellecour.fr/">Bellecour Ecole</a>.<br/>
                There I learned Unreal Engine and Unity to get a productive level.<br/>
                I mastered the languages C/C++ and C#, with all the workaround about organization, unit testing, agile...<br/>
                At the same time with Rust on the side served me as my main utility languages, when I was needing tools to improve my workflow during projects (thanks <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>).<br/>
                <br/>
                And right now I am at the end of the studies doing the final project. And trying to make a place for me in this world.<br/>
