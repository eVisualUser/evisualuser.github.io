<h1>Game Jam (November 2023)</h1>

<p>Organized by the <a href="https://www.bellecour.fr/">school</a> themself, we got 36 hours to make a game.
	The teams was define ealier by the administration, and I got a place in a team of 5 people.</p>
<br/>
<p>I was with a game programmer from the first year of bachelore (I am currently at second year), with aslo two game
	designers from the third year. And with another game designer from the second year.</p>
<p>The requirement where using <a href="https://unity.com/fr">Unity</a> and respecting the theme <b>One Shot</b>.</p>

<h3>So the ideas was:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Insprired by volley ball.</li>
	<li>Scoring system based on where the ball goes.</li>
	<li>Two side in the level where enemies can send you back the ball.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>What was the difficulties (programming only):</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Making mechanics that are precise in a short time.</li>
	<li>Level integration coming late making bugs appearnig at the last minutes.</li>
	<li>Not enough game designers to create the levels and the UI (I have done the UI at the last minute).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>What I learn:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's important to ask for test as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Keep an eye on the game designers to spot a problem before they found it.</li>
	<li>Explaining clearly how things works to the non technical people and help them to understand and avoid
		communication
		issues.
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
	It was a really great Game Jam, and the collaboration side was very cool.
	Everyone have made it's best even with missing members.
