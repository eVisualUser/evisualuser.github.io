<h1>Game Jam (November 2023)</h1>

<p>Organized by the <a href="https://www.bellecour.fr/">school</a>, we got 36 hours to make a game.
	The team were defining earlier by the administration, and I got a place in a team of five people.</p>
<br/>
<p>I was with a game programmer from the first year of bachelor (I am currently at second year), with aslo two game
	designers from the third year. And with another game designer from the second year.</p>
<p>The requirement where using <a href="https://unity.com/fr">Unity</a> and respecting the theme <b>One Shot</b>.</p>

<h3>So the idea was:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Inspired by volley ball.</li>
	<li>Scoring system based on where the ball goes.</li>
	<li>Two sides in the level where enemies can send you back the ball.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>What was the difficulty (programming only):</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Making mechanics that are precise in a short time.</li>
	<li>Level integration coming late making bugs appearing at the last minutes.</li>
	<li>Not enough game designers to create the levels and the UI (I have done the UI at the last minute).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>What I learn:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's important to ask for test as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Keep an eye on the game designers to spot a problem before they find it.</li>
	<li>Explaining clearly how things work to the non-technical people and help them to understand and avoid
		communication
		issues.
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
	It was a really great Game Jam, and the collaboration side was very cool.
	Everyone has made its best.
