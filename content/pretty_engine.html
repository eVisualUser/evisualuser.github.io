            <h2>Why ?</h2>
            <p>
                This is the most important question, and here it's performances and architecture.
                I need an engine to build games with great performances by default.
                <br/><br/>
                And in the other hand, I want to learn how to build it, to improve my skills in general programming.
                As it is also a goal for me to become in the future a Game Engine programmer.
                This one told me a lot, about how to play with memory, to writing flexible and robust code.
                By exploring features like multi-threading, SIMD, Vulkan and OpenGL, I build a range of references,
                useful in many context.
                <br/><br/>
                I don't have a date for the end of the development, because I still have too much to learn.
                But one day I will done a game with the engine, and this one will close the 1.0 version.

            <h2>Current state of devlopement.</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, the engine have a good reflection system, with a multithreaded initialization.
                The asset manager is working well but the bundle support is not complete (for release only).
                <br/><br/>
                I rewrited for the third time the renderer after trying with OpenGL and Vulkan.
                But since using vulkan I was learning at the same time, I have to rewrite it to have something more flexible and robust.
                <br/><br/>
                The architecture choosed for the user side, is the combination of three solutions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>DynamicObject equivalent of GameObjects.</li>
                <li>Entity Component System.</li>
                <li>Process created at the initialization and destroyed at the end only.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You got also reflected configurations inspired by the UDataAssets from Unreal Engine(equivalent of ScriptableObject in Unity).
