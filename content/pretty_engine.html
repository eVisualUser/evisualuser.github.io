            <h2>Why ?</h2>
            <p>
                This is the most important question, and here it's performances and architecture.
                I need an engine to build games with great performances by default.
                Compared to other engines that by default are already too slow by default.
                <br/><br/>
                And in the other hand, I want to learn how to build it, to improve my skills in general programming.
                As it is also a goal for me to become in the future a Game Engine programmer.
                This one told me a lot, about how to cheat using memory, to writing flexible and robust code.
                By exploring features like multi-threading, SIMD, Vulkan and OpenGL, I build a range of references,
                useful in many context.
                <br/><br/>
                I don't have a date for the end of the development, because I have too much to learn.
                But one day I will done a game with the engine, and this one will close the 1.0 version of the engine.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Current state of devlopement.</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, the engine have a good reflection system, with a multithreaded initialization.
                The asset manager is in the good way, but require improvement by using GUIDs instead of the name or path.
                The bundle support is not complete (for release only).
                <br/><br/>
                I rewrited for the third time the renderer after trying with OpenGL and Vulkan.
                But since using vulkan I was learning at the same time, I have to rewrite it to have something more flexible and robust.
                <br/><br/>
                The architecture choosed for the user side, is the combination of three solutions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. DynamicObject equivalent of GameObjects.</li>
                <li>2. You will have sDynamicObject that are the equivalent of GameObjects.</li>
                <li>2. Process created at the initialization and destroyed at the end only.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
