            <h2>First project at Bellecour Ecole</h2>

            <p>
                For the first year, we had to create a GameBook in C/C++.
                We got 2 month.
                And I had to work with three Game Designers.

            <h2>Programming</h2>

            <p>
                I used CMake and use only EMScripten as dependency.
                The idea was to be able to select a choice and hide the ones that the condition don't pass.
                <br/><br/>
                To achieve it, I recreated a simple parser of Toml file (not full featured).<br/>
                Each page got a title and a text, each button can open a page, and or modify player inventory.<br/>
                <br/><br/>
                Based on that and an external editor I built, Game Designers where able to write the story and put it in the game,
                easily.
                <br/><br/>
                <a href="https://evisualuser.github.io/izydor/">The game is available online.</a>
