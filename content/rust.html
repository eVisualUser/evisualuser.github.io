            <p>
                Outside of making games, I need to build tools, and my favorite language for it, is Rust.
                Specifically using <a href="https://tauri.app/" class="link">Tauri</a>, a simple example is my utility <a href="https://github.com/eVisualUser/game-engine-launcher" class="link">Unreal Engine launcher</a>.
                I love the way Rust is built, with a robust and safety aspect, making it a great language when you want to build
                tools fast but keeping it reliable.
                <br/><br/>
                To expand why it's my favorite, is because of the strictness.
                Rust will force you to code well, either it is going to be punishing really fast.
                Event if some features like procedural macros allow to have some fun.
                It's a really powerful languages.
                <br/><br/>
                Except when it's about multithreading.
                Sometime you will have to use ways ending up
                by removing the multithreading because the synchronization cost too much performances.
