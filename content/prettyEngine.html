<p>Work in progress game engine for 2D games.
	<br/>
	I am currently working on it to learn game engine development.
	It will end by making a game using it, probably an open-world 2D game.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	For the creation part, coding must be done in C++ only, but with a simplified pipeline
	The editor manage all the artist part.
	<br/>
	To create a game you need to duplicate the code of the engine and compile it yourself if you add some script,
	this is to allow you to customize the engine, and also the C++ scripting part need it.
	This allows the editor to have access to your custom Components and Entities.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	For the organization you can script Entities that will work standalone, and you can use polymorphism on it.
	You can also create components that is more dynamic but have some performances and memory cost.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	It is written in C++ and using <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
	I choose C++ because I wanted to create an engine that would train me to improve my skills in this language.
	By C++ being very important in Game Engine development, I found it necessary to be sure that I learn things
	applicable to the industry.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I use <a href="https://go.dev/">Go lang</a> to write scripts that manage the engine sources and dependencies.
	It target to improve the ease
	of use of the engine by installing the dependencies and generating the files, and requiering only to have <a
		href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>
	installed.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	For the launcher I use <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, to have a solution easy to maintain and get great
	visuals, compared to most of native GUI/UI frameworks.
	And compared to <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> I get better performances and it's based on my
	favorite programming
	language: <a
		href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>

<p>In a near future the engine will be available on the GitHub repository under the MIT license.</p>
<p>For now the engine is a bit messy and I actullay work on improving it's architecture and tools around it. Because I
	learn rendering and physics simulation using this project I need to improve a lot of things.</p>
<p>There is a long way to go before having a first stable version.</p>
