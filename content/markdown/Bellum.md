## Goal

It was the second game project at Bellecour Ecole.
The goal was to create a Free to Play, with a fake shop system.
Just to allow game designers to challenge their ideas.

## Gameplay

Its in 2D pixel art, top-down perspective, and fighting against enemies using close combat weapons, such as swords and spears.

Made using Unity for Android only.

## Shop system

The shop allow to buy skins of weapons and weapons.
You have two currencies.

When you buy an item, it registers in local storage the token of this item.

Then it will check if you have the token meaning you have the item.
Yet simple, it worked perfectly.

I made a tool to manage easily the tokens and implementing skins and weapons easily.

## Issues

There was many issues with this project:
- Game designers choice wasn't clear
- Too many changes at the last minute
- Game designer missing skills with Unity
- I was missing knowledge on programming a 2D game with Unity.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience.
I learned a lot about game design, programming, and Unity.
I also learned how to work on a project with multiple people with different skills and different roles.

An important step in my learning process, that helped me later to focus more on communication and ensuring a clear vision with the team.
