Pretty-Launcher is a single Tauri 2.0 application.
It provides an uniform platform to making tools for non programmers.
Including a store to download plugins easily.

After having to make multiple desktop app as tools for non programmers,
I decided to make a single application to hold them all.
And include features to help making them faster.

At the same time, the store allows sharing plugins easily.
It also provides a way to easily update plugins and keep them up to date.

In result, the target audience, wont have to look at the documentation to find plugins.
They will have them correctly listed at a single place.
The cross-platform nature of Tauri allows for easy deployment on multiple operating systems.
And you won't have to worry about the platform you are using.

The application is still in development.
A lot of features are missing.
But you can already build it yourself, to try it out.
Its not recommended to use it yet.

You can find the source code on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/eVisualUser/pretty-launcher).
I recommend looking at the [documentation](https://gitlab.com/eVisualUser/pretty-launcher/-/blob/cd02a8a735721fecf83cc9e97485e5c31e4cda33/README.md) first.

## CLI Support

A work-in-progress important feature is the CLI.

The CLI allows managing plugins and debugging the application.
Without any complex graphics, it allows to be run light.
It's less of a priority than the application itself.
But it is worked in on in parralel.
