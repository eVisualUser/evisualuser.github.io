# Project Survival

In the south, a new kind of predator appeared.
After a country working on bio weapons, had a laboratory got sabotaged.
A virus escaped, turning people into a new kind of predators.

The government built a wall to protect them from coming into the territory.
And it worked well for a while.
But then came the silence, the contact of a city was lost. No images, no videos,
just a reckless horde that destroyed the city on its way.
Nobody knows how the horde came there, as the wall is still intact.

Then the migration to the north started. Millions of people, make their way to the north.
And you, you lead a group of survivors, trying to flee and survive.
Yet the way to the north is complicated and can't be made in a single trip.
You'll have to travel, from places to places, then settle temporary shelters to scavenge the resources needed to continue.
Will you succeed to escape the horde, and will the horde ever stop?

## Core Mechanics

- **The Ticking Clock:** Zombie density increases exponentially the longer you stay in a single zone.
- **Resource Management:** Balance the need for food and fuel against the encroaching threat.
- **Halfway Locations:** Strategic "emergency stops" that are smaller and more dangerous, forcing high-intensity combat in tight spaces with minimal rewards.
- **Story Cards:** Narrative events with permanent consequences for your group.
- **Progression of Scarcity:** As you move North, safe locations become smaller and resources more rare, increasing the pressure on every decision.
