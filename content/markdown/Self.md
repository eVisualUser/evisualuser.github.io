## How I got into programming

I started programming to write simple applications in python. For fun mostly.

Then I wanted to make a game with Unity, that required to learn C#.
And so, with C# I experimented with Unity, WPF and Winform.

After making a little zombie game with Unity.
I found out that I enjoyed programming and wanted to learn more.
I later started learning C++ and Rust, and I started working on my own projects.

That led me to Unreal Engine and godot.
So I got into Bellecour Ecole, and started a Bachelor in game programming.

## Now

I finished my Bachelor in game programming at Bellecour Ecole.
I am now looking for a job as a junior game programmer.
