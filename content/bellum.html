            <h2>School Project</h2>
            <p>
                The project is the one for the second year of the bachelor.<br/>
                As for goal, we had to make a free to play model.<br/>
                And requiring to run on <b>Android</b>.<br/>
                In a limited time of <b>4 months</b>.

            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                The concept is a topdown, and fighting game.
                You have to reach the end while killing all the enemies.
                <br/>
                The integration of the Free to Play is by allowing buying player character skins and weapons.

            <h2>My contribution</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I was in <b>charge of the programming</b>.
                <b>Powered by Unity</b>, I built the storing system for item purchasing and "money" counter, since it was required to be a fake system.
                All of it was <b>stored in a json in local</b>.
                <br/><br/>
                Also the fighting system and the AI was pretty simple to do.
                Where things become interesting was supporting the skins,
                that was having different visuals, animations, and sounds.
                <br/><br/>
                Using <b>ScriptableObjects</b> I succeed to find a clean solution and flexible.
                As well the AI was configured by them, making it easily possible to create a second enemy faction (not used),
                without requiring adding new code.
                <br/><br/>
                In conclusion this project was more about putting learned skills on <b>Unity</b> to build a game in <b>collaboration</b>
                with Game Designers.
