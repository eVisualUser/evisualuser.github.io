What I did:
</h2>
<p>
I have done all the programming of the project.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Remade a 2D animation system to simplify the skin system integration and improve Game Designers workflow. Also created a tool that allow them to just follow the steps of creation without taking care of the implementation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Added a fighting system with weapons having skins and class that can impact the player motor.
	</li>
	<li>
		Worked on a concept of Token to manage the support of buying things as one time only but without requiring code.
	</li>
	<li>
		Support of different currencies to buy in the shop.
	</li>
	<li>
		Added a system to save player data.
	</li>
</ul>
