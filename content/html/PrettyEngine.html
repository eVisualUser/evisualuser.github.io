<h2>Engine Concept</h2>
<p>
    This engine is for learning purpose.<br />
    Multithreaded and using
    <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/">Vulkan API</a> for rendering.<br />
    The idea is be able to create with it a 3D game, that is easy to extend and
    maintainable.<br />
</p>

<h2>State of devolvement</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The world/level system is work in progress.</li>
    <li>
        The rendering engine wait for the world/level system to be finished to
        manage resources properly.
    </li>
    <li>The asset manager is in improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>
    The engine is in its third version, and it teach me a lot.<br />
    <br />
    So the choice to do multithreading and using Vulkan come from the issues I
    met mostly in the first version.<br />
    The first version was using OpenGL, it was in fact more advanced, but less
    stable, and the performances was just acceptable.<br />
    <br />
    Multithreading is very important in modern programming, and for example in
    the current version it allow a very fast initialization.<br />
    <br />
    From it, I found a passion for engine programming, the level of complexity
    and the creativity coming with it.<br />
