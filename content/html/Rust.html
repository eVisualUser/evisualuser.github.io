<p>Compared to others this one is to present my use of Rust.</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>
    Rust is my main language when it come to external tools.<br />
    Because of its great performances and the great amount of libraries
    available.<br />
    <br />
    My favorite GUI framework is
    <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri (v2.0)</a>.<br />
    It is an alternative to Electron, but with better performances and
    lighter.<br />
    <br />
    Most of the libraries are cross-platform, making it easily compatible
    between Linux and Windows.<br />
</p>

<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>
    This is a powerful and safe language.<br />
    But it come with difficulties when using async code.<br />
    <br />
    The community is great, and the documentation is complete.<br />
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Rust is a great language for building high-performance applications.<br />
    It has a great community and a lot of libraries available.<br />
    <br />
    I recommend it for anyone who wants to build a fast and reliable
    application.<br />
